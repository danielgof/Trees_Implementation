# Trees implementation using Java(personal course)
## Tree Implementation
Implement a basic tree class in Java with appropriate methods for creating, inserting, and deleting nodes.
Test the tree implementation with sample data and verify the correctness of the operations.
Find height of a tree, size and width of a tree.
## Tree Traversal Algorithms
Implement recursive and iterative approaches for pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals of a binary tree.
Compare the performance and memory usage of the different traversal methods.
Apply the traversal algorithms to solve a specific problem, such as finding the sum of all nodes in the tree.
## Binary Search Tree Operations
Implement insertion, deletion, and searching operations for a binary search tree (BST) in Java.
Test the BST operations with various input cases, including edge cases, and ensure the correctness of the operations.
Implement a method to balance the BST (e.g., using AVL tree or red-black tree algorithms) and analyze the impact on performance.
## Advanced Tree Operations
Write a program to find the height and depth of a given tree.
Implement a method to calculate the size and count the number of nodes in a tree.
Solve a problem that involves identifying common tree patterns, such as finding common ancestors or determining if one tree is a subtree of another.
## Tree-Based Application
Develop a file system simulation using a tree data structure in Java.
Implement operations like creating directories, adding files, navigating the file system tree, and performing searches.
Test the file system application with various scenarios, ensuring proper functionality and error handling.
## Tree Visualization and Analysis
Use a Java library (e.g., JavaFX or Swing) to visualize a given tree structure graphically.
Analyze the time complexity of different tree operations and compare them.
Optimize a specific tree operation (e.g., searching, insertion) and measure the performance improvement.
## Project: Decision Tree Classifier
Design and implement a decision tree classifier in Java.
Train the classifier using a given dataset and evaluate its performance on test data.
Include functionality for pruning the decision tree to avoid overfitting.
